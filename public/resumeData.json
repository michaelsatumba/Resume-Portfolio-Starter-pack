		"bio": "I have used my Kinesiology degree to help people by being a personal trainer, swim instructor, CrossFit coach, and movement teacher. I wanted to use my Kinesiology degree to get others to move more and possibly go into public health and work my way writing physical activity guidelines. After finding how much more school was needed to pursue another degree in public health, I wanted to think of other ways to impact health. That's when I thought about software. Multiple software programs affect health like FitBit, Apple Health, Oura, and countless other fitness apps. I started by watching Youtube tutorials, then going through some online courses, and eventually, I took some courses at SF State in the CS department. And now I am trying to pursue a graduate certificate in software engineering. I'm obsessed with solving problems in Kinesiology using React, Firebase, and Node by building web and mobile applications with an emphasis on accessibility and usability. I'm currently looking to contribute my skills to a team where I can prove my skills while growing in my capabilities. If you are looking for a competent, highly-motivated developer, let's chat.

During his time working with me he was responsible with developing the frontend of the website using React Native and Firestore as the tech stack. Right away I was impressed with his ability to take initiative and get started on development as soon as he was able to. Within the first few days, he gave me a working prototype of the site. He demonstrated amazing ability to follow instructions but at the same time solve problems on his own when they arose. What impressed me the most about Michael is his drive to work hard. He’s not someone that will sit around and wait to be assigned problems, but instead will take care of them as he come across them. I’m confident that whatever responsibilities Michael is assigned he can get it done.",
