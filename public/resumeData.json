		"bio": "I have used my Kinesiology degree to help people by being a personal trainer, swim instructor, CrossFit coach, and movement teacher. I wanted to use my Kinesiology degree to get others to move more and possibly go into public health and work my way writing physical activity guidelines. After finding how much more school was needed to pursue another degree in public health, I wanted to think of other ways to impact health. That's when I thought about software. Multiple software programs affect health like FitBit, Apple Health, Oura, and countless other fitness apps. I started by watching Youtube tutorials, then going through some online courses, and eventually, I took some courses at SF State in the CS department. And now I am trying to pursue a graduate certificate in software engineering. I'm obsessed with solving problems in Kinesiology using React, Firebase, and Node by building web and ios applications with an emphasis on accessibility and usability. I'm currently looking to contribute my skills to a team where I can prove my skills while growing in my capabilities. If you are looking for a competent, highly-motivated developer, let's chat.
